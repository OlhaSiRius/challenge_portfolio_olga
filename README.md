# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I chose to participate as the course is _free_ and I wanted to learn _more_ about **testing**. 
At the end of the project I would like to understand enough to know if I want to continue learning or focus on something else.
Thank you for your support.
